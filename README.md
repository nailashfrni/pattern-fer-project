## Description
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has been an important tasks in the realm of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to extract critical features and classify the types of human emotions. In this project, we utilize CK+ (Cohn-Kanade Plus) dataset which is a popular dataset for facial expression analysis, featuring sequences from neutral to peak expressions. The dataset consist of 920 images with 48x48 pixel each.

The methodology that we use for this project varied from Traditional Method to Transfer Learning.
1. Traditional Method -- SVM
2. Deep Neural Network -- CNN
3. Transfer Learning -- ResNet50
